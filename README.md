# BuckleScript Chrome

This repository aims to provide [BuckleScript](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript) bindings to the [Google Chrome extensions API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) so users can write Chrome apps in OCaml.

The `examples/` directory contains a file consuming the bindings, for reference.

An example Chrome extension can be found at [`thoughtbot/bs-google-drive-slideshow`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bs-google-drive-slideshow).
